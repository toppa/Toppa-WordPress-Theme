Toppa-WordPress-Theme
=====================

The custom WordPress theme used for [toppa.com](toppa.com). It's a responsive, two-column theme, and includes a fairly minimal set of theme files (because I don't need a crazy complicated theme). At toppa.com, I write blog posts on several different topics (organized using WordPress categories), so this theme is designed to present the content in a partitioned manner, making it easy for people who are interested in only one topic to not be distracted by what I write on other topics.

Note this theme is not plug-n-play. It has several hardcoded dependencies on toppa.com categories, which you would need to edit to suit your categories. Also be warned it is surprisingly difficult to keep track of descendant child categories in WordPress, for certain purposes. The theme could definitely use some abstraction around the categories, but until someone asks for it...
